    <h1>Hello Rangers 127 Cohort!</h1>
    <p>
        We are very excited to kick off the next 10 weeks with y'all. But it's very
        important, before we begin, for us to know how funny y'all are. 
    </p>

        Please add below in a p tag your favorite joke. Once complete, push up to Github & send a pull
        request to your cool instructor, Alex. Thanks!

        I don't think I have a favorite joke, and that's ironic as someone who dabbles in improv 
        and standup.  More than likely I just don't like the "favorite" type of questions haha. 
        Most of my best jokes I write are sexual in nature, and I'd rather play it safe than to potentially
        violate the student contract, so Google will have to suffice:
        <br>
        <br>
        Thereâ€™s a fine line between a numerator and a denominator.
        <br>
        <br>
        Only a fraction of people will get this joke
